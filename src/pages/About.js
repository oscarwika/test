            <h2>My Story</h2>
            <p>
              Hola! My name is Naari! I've been involved with animal care since I was 15. 
              My love for dogs and cats began when I moved back to the Caribbean after living 
              a few years in Laguna Beach, California. Returning to Puerto Rico, I was 
              heartbroken to see so many stray animals, and immediately felt called to help. 
              That passion led me to volunteer work, and soon after, I found myself helping 
              families integrate shy or sensitive adopted pets into their homes.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              In the last few years I have also worked with active dogs that help keep me 
              in shape and inspire me to spend more time outdoors! Being away from their 
              environment and/or family doesn't have to be a stressful experience for your pup. 
              I aim to create a positive, enriching experience, where they're free to roam 
              the house (no crates unless requested) and enjoy plenty of time in nature.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              With your approval, I can even offer safe, supervised off-leash adventures 
              in secure outdoor spaces.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              As a bonus, I'm also a photographer! I offer fun beachside dog photography 
              session for an additional fee â€” perfect for capturing special memories of their stay.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              Daily photos and videos are always included, along with bathing or brushing 
              if needed during their stay. I look forward to caring for your furry family 
              member like one of my own!

                  relaxed and secure, just like they would in their own home.
