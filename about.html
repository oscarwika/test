            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>Hola! My name is Naari! I've been involved with animal care since I was 15. My love for dogs and cats begun when I moved back to the Caribbean after living a few years in Southern California. Upon returning to the island I was shocked with how many stray dogs and cats roam Puerto Rico, I immediately became involved with volunteering and eventually found myself working with people that needed help transitioning their shy adopted pet into their family.</p>
            <p>I'm familiar with sensitive and one on one care for dogs that are shy, experience separation anxiety and need a more personal care.</p>
            <p>In the last few years I have also worked with active dogs that help keep me in shape and inspire me to spend more time outdoors! Being away from their environment or/and family doesn't have to be a stressful experience for your pup! Instead I strive in creating a fun and dynamic experience during the entire time of their sitting. They're free to roam the entire home, without being contained to a crate and will enjoy regular outside time in nature. I can also provide allowing them to run off leash in safe outdoor spaces with supervision and approval of you of course.</p>
            <p>I'm currently studying Integrative Health online this semester and have much more time and freedom then the average sitter.</p>
            <p>On the side I also do photography and would be happy to provide a beach photoshoot of you dog for an additional fee.</p>
            <p>Day to day pictures and videos will be provided along with showering them if needed during the stay.</p>
